# Hack your own way
You have been implemented the basic back-end of portfolio application.  
Now it's time to hack portfolio application in your way!


## STEP 1. Choose features to implement and work on it!
We provide you 7 features to implement. One is required and other 6 features are optional.  
Choose 2 features, including feature with `[MUST]`, from those 7 features and implement it.

There is no test code for this challenge.  
Try implementing features as many as possible, to show off your skills and spirit of challenging!!  
"I've implemented test code by myself" is one way to appeal your skills ;)

Instead of having no test code, we will ask you guys to write [answer.md](answer.md) about your thoughts: things that you have tried, points that you care most, things that you've failed, etc.

**Reviewer will read this [answer.md](answer.md) before they see your code**.  
Don't forget to write where you want reviewers to see!

### [MUST]   Implement front-end
Please implement client side of portfolio application.  
You either can design by your self, find some cool template, or just show some text focus on back-end features; it's your choice!

### [OPTION] Implement pagination feature
You will need to have pagination feature if you want to show the list of something.  
Implement pagination feature, and explain the architecture that you have chosen!

### [OPTION] Implement validation feature
Validation is a really important feature to keep your service safe and clean.
Add validation feature, and design the error handling architecture!

### [OPTION] Implement image upload feature
For portfolio, you will need some image to show your cool projects!  
Make feature to upload image, and think how to manage images.

### [OPTION] Implement categorize feature
If you have many projects, you will start to feel that you want to categorize them.
Implement tag feature would be good idea to organize your project!

### [OPTION] Integration with other service
Integration with outer services became popular in these days.
Think how to integrate your service to one another, and implement that feature!

### [OPTION] Any other ideas are welcome!!
There will be millions of ideas that you could think of other than we listed.
Write down your ideas in [answer.md](answer.md) first, and try implement that feature to give birth to your great idea.

## STEP 2. Deploy your service!
After you implemented your service, please deploy your service to somewhere public and write your url in [answer.md](answer.md) so that reviewers can see your service through their browser!

## STEP 3. Finish your [answer.md](answer.md)
Please write your thoughts, things that you have tried, succeed, or failed, your ideas, or anything in [answer.md](answer.md)!
